    <p>And all I am is a man</p>
    <p>I want the world in my hands</p>
    <p> I hate the beach but I stand</p>
    <p> In California with my toes in the sand</p>
    <p>  Use the sleeves of my sweater</p>
    <p>Let's have an adventure</p>
    <p> Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered</p>
    <p> Touch my neck and I'll touch yours</p>
    <p>  You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh</p>
    <p>She knows what I think about</p>
    <p>And what I think about</p>
    <p> One love, two mouths</p>
    <p>  One love, one house</p>
    <p>  No shirt, no blouse</p>
    <p>  Just us, you find out</p>
    <p> Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no</p>
    <p> 'Cause it's too cold</p>
    <p>  For you here and now</p>
    <p> So let me hold</p>
    <p> Both your hands in the holes of my sweater</p>
    <p> And if I may just take your breath away</p>
    <p> I don't mind if there's not much to say</p>
    <p> Sometimes the silence guides our minds</p>
    <p> So move to a place so far away</p>
    <p>The goosebumps start to raise</p>
    <p> The minute that my left hand meets your waist</p>
    <p> And then I watch your face</p>
    <p>Put my finger on your tongue</p>
    <p>'Cause you love to taste, yeah</p>
    <p>These hearts adore</p>
    <p> Everyone the other beats hardest for</p>
    <p>Inside this place is warm</p>
    <p> Outside it starts to pour</p>
    <p> Coming down</p>
    <p> One love, two mouths</p>
    <p> One love, one house</p>
    <p> No shirt, no blouse</p>
    <p> Just us, you find out</p>
    <p>Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no</p>
    <p> 'Cause it's too cold</p>
    <p> For you here and now</p>
    <p>  So let me hold</p>
    <p> Both your hands in the holes of my sweater</p>
    <p> 'Cause it's too cold</p>
    <p>  For you here and now</p>
    <p>  So let me hold</p>
    <p> Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, whoa</p>
    <p> Whoa, whoa, whoa</p>
    <p> Whoa, whoa, whoa</p>
    <p> Whoa, whoa</p>
    <p> Whoa, whoa, whoa</p>
    <p> Whoa, whoa</p>
    <p> 'Cause it's too cold</p>
    <p>  For you here and now</p>
    <p>  So let me hold</p>
    <p> Both your hands in the holes of my sweater</p>
    <p>  It's too cold</p>
    <p>  For you here and now</p>
    <p> Let me hold</p>
    <p> Both your hands in the holes of my sweater</p>
    <p> And it's too cold</p>
    <p> It's too cold</p>
    <p> The holes of my sweater</p>
